This project is a simulation of a comprehensive reconstruction plan for after-war regions. The simulation system aimed to evaluating various reconstruction plans, each distinguished by different prioritization strategies.
In this project, I've created a C++ program to manage and simulate various “reconstruction plans.” The program has defined multiple plans, each focused on reconstructing
specific settlement. It's also consider different strategies, such as whether to build a school or an office building, and perform simulation steps to evaluate how these decisions impact the outcome.
